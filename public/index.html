            <p>Background Information: You are creating an account for a shopping website. The only required field is
                username and you are free to include as many security measures
                as you want. As a shopping website you should imagine that your financial information MAY be linked to
                your
                account, however, you would also have the ability
                to remove it at any time. Furthermore, the shopping website would allow 3rd-party payment options that
                would
                need additional user engagement. Lastly,
                information concerning various security measures is included and can be accessed by clicking on buttons
                labeled "INFO", however, they are not required to be read.

                        One way is that they can be used
                        in order to recover a lost or stolen account. Another way is that companies can warn users about
                        any suspicious activity or data breaches. One last way is that emails are sometimes used as a
                        form of multi-factor authentication</p>

                        can lock unwanted individuals from accessing an account. Passwords can range in strength,
                        depending on the characters used, complexity, and length. Generally, a strong password
                        should be at least 8 - 12 characters, unique (not used for other accounts), have a mixture of
                        both
                        uppercase and lowercase letters, contain numbers, and contain at least one special character.

                    <p id='mfa' style='display: none'>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is an additional security
                        measure that
                        can help keep unwanted intruders from accessing an account. It does this by making the owner of
                        the account confirm their identity through a secondary source. Some of these sources include a
                        security key, authentication app, SMS, and email. Although beneficial, MFA can be inconvenient,
                        due to requiring an extra step for sign-in. Furthermore, the different authenticators have
                        different pros and cons.<br><br>

                        SMS and email are usually more easy to access, however there are larger
                        risks if an individual gains access to either service. Furthermore, they have risks of phishing
                        attacks.<br><br>

                        Authenticator apps are also easy to access, however if an individual loses access of their
                        phone, they may have trouble logging into their account. Additionally, phishing attacks may
                        trick
                        an individual into entering their authentication code.<br><br>

                        A physical security key is the most secure, as it is not at risk of phishing attacks (security
                        keys check the website/application being used in order to ensure they are legitimate. Although
                        the most secure they are also the least convenient, due to requiring the user to have a physical
                        object to sign-in.<br><br>

                        Although an individual might think more authentication options will make them more secure, it is
                        actually the opposite. An individual is better off with only one or two authentication options
                        as more options may put user at higher risk.
